# Demo-Employees

The purpose of this project is to practice the concept of inheritance.

My code includes 4 classes to demonstrate inheritance. There is an Employee class with attributes that every employee should have, SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee with specialized attributes, and DemoEmployees. Every class, except DemoEmployees, shares a display method to demonstrate method overriding! During the demo 3 new employees are created to demonstrate an employee with a salary, an employee with hourly earnings per year, and an employee with overtime included in the hourly earnings per year.
